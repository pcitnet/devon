# Mabel Lee: A Pillar of Coleford’s History and Hospitality

**Mabel Kathleen Lee**, born on **July 31, 1901**, at The New Inn in **Coleford, Devon**, played a pivotal role in the village's history. As the youngest of five children born to **William and Emmeline Lee**, Mabel's life revolved around her family and the hospitality industry. Her legacy continues to inspire those passionate about community and tradition.

## The Lee Family’s Connection to Coleford and Hospitality

Mabel’s story is deeply rooted in **Coleford’s historical pubs**. Her maternal grandparents, **Thomas Peters** and **Anna Maria Grey**, managed The Ship Inn in Coleford from 1849, later taking over **The New Inn** in 1854. After Thomas's passing in 1875, Anna Maria managed the inn for over two decades, becoming a respected figure in the village.

In 1892, their daughter Emmeline married **William Lee**, a skilled builder and carpenter. When Anna Maria passed away in 1899, William assumed the tenancy of **The New Inn**. Tragically, his death in 1905 left Emmeline to manage the pub while raising five children: **Thomas, Ellen (Nellie), Mary, William (Bill), and Mabel**.

## Tragedy and Resilience in the Lee Family

The Lee family endured significant hardships. **Nellie**, who served as a nurse, passed away in April 1917. Just months later, **Thomas** died in Egypt while serving in the **Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers** during World War I. Despite these losses, Emmeline and Mabel worked tirelessly to maintain the inn's operations and its role in the community.

## The New Inn: From Tenancy to Ownership

In 1919, during a local estate breakup, Emmeline seized the opportunity to purchase **The New Inn** at auction. This milestone ensured the inn remained a cornerstone of the village. Through the 1920s and 1930s, Emmeline and Mabel worked together to run the pub, with Mabel increasingly taking on leadership responsibilities.

Mabel's siblings, **Mary and Bill**, frequently supported the family business, handling tasks like milking the house cow and tending to livestock. Meanwhile, Mabel became a beloved community figure, contributing to local events such as the annual revel and church fundraisers. Her contralto singing voice made her a standout in village drama productions.

## Mabel Lee’s Contribution to Coleford’s Community

Mabel Lee's dedication went beyond running The New Inn. She actively supported the local community, forming connections that left an indelible mark on **Coleford’s history**. Her involvement in events and fundraisers strengthened the social fabric of the village, earning her a lasting place in its legacy.

## Retirement and Lifelong Dedication to Coleford

After her mother’s passing in 1939, Mabel managed **The New Inn** single-handedly until 1959, when she sold it to new owners. Her final night at the inn was unforgettable, with patrons invited to serve themselves—a fitting farewell to her decades of service.

In her retirement, Mabel lived in **Copplestone**, **Exeter**, and later **Crediton**, yet her ties to Coleford remained unbroken. She continued to support **Colebrooke Church** and the church at Knowle. Honoring her mother’s wishes, Mabel ensured the upkeep of family graves in **Colebrooke Churchyard**.
