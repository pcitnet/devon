# James Stone: The Little Elephant of Devonshire Wrestling (1798–1841)

James Stone, famously known as "The Little Elephant," was a celebrated Devonshire wrestler and farmer. Born on **March 28, 1798**, in Crediton, Devon, James's incredible strength and unmatched skill in Devonshire wrestling earned him a prominent place in British sporting history.

## Early Life of James Stone

James Stone was born at **Knowle Farm, Crediton**, the second son of James Stone and Elizabeth Francis. In **1804**, his family moved to **Furzedown Farm in Copplestone**, within the parish of Colebrooke. This farm had been in the Stone family for nearly a century, marking their deep-rooted ties to the region.

## A Champion of Devonshire Wrestling

As a young man, James Stone became a prominent figure in **Devonshire wrestling**, a traditional style known for allowing kicks below the knee. His small stature—**5 feet 4 inches tall and weighing over 13 stone**—earned him the affectionate nickname "The Little Elephant." Despite his size, James's incredible strength made him a formidable competitor.

### James Stone’s Achievements in Wrestling

- Widely regarded as second only to his friend **Abraham Cann**, the 1828 "Champion of all England."
- Competed in high-profile matches across England, including **Leeds** and **The Eagle Tavern in London**.

## Life After Wrestling: Marriage and Farming

James Stone married **Ann Gibbings** on **November 1, 1828**, in Coldridge, Crediton. Ann, born at Chilverton Farm in Coldridge, brought a strong farming background to the union. Together, they settled at **Hooke Farm**, which they acquired from James's sister, Mary.

By **1839**, the couple had seven children, with another on the way. James’s life as a farmer seemed promising, but his ambitions soon turned toward opportunities abroad.

## The Journey to Australia

In **July 1840**, James left for **Sydney, New South Wales**, seeking a new life for his family. He secured a position as a station manager for Samuel Furneaux Mann, a major landowner in the **New England district**.

### Tragic End: The Murder of James Stone

On **July 28, 1841**, James Stone was tragically murdered at Beardy Plains, New England. The incident occurred during a dispute with **Thomas Homer**, a convict laborer. Homer was later tried, convicted of willful murder, and executed in **1842**.

## Ann Stone’s Life After James

Back in Devon, Ann Stone managed **Hooke Farm** until their eldest son, James Jr., took over in **1861**. Ann later moved to **Lower Chilverton Farm**, where she lived with her brothers. She passed away on **July 9, 1874**, after a carriage accident and was laid to rest in **Coldridge churchyard**.
