# The Salter Sisters: Devon’s Beloved "Devonshire Nightingales"

Florence and Bertha Salter, affectionately known as the *"Devonshire Nightingales"*, were celebrated classical vocalists originating from the picturesque village of Colebrooke, Devon. Their melodious voices and remarkable careers have left a lasting legacy in the world of classical music.

## Early Life and Rise to Fame

Born at **Broomhill Farm** in 1870 (Florence) and 1872 (Bertha), the Salter sisters grew up surrounded by the serene beauty of rural Devon. Their musical journey began with a promising concert at **Crediton Town Hall** in 1890. Encouraged by their talented singing instructor, **Mr. Jekyll of Exeter**, the sisters pursued professional training in Brussels, refining their vocal artistry.

In 1893, their undeniable talent brought them before **Queen Marie Henriette of Belgium** and **Princess Clementine**, a royal audience that solidified their reputation. Their performances in **Biarritz**, attended by **King Oscar of Sweden**, also earned widespread acclaim, with the French press hailing their extraordinary abilities.

## A Flourishing Career: The Devonshire Nightingales

For over two decades, the Salter sisters captivated audiences across Britain and Europe. Touring extensively, they gained the affectionate title of the *"Devonshire Nightingales."* By 1901, the sisters had settled in **Paddington, London**, listed as "classical vocalists" in the census. A decade later, they moved to **Chelsea**, continuing to thrive as "professional vocalists."

One of their final recorded performances occurred in **September 1917**, where they sang to support a military hospital in **Colchester**, demonstrating their commitment to using their talents for good causes.

## Returning to Devon: A Quiet Retirement

In the 1930s, Florence and Bertha returned to their Devon roots, settling in the seaside town of **Dawlish**. Florence passed away in 1942 and was buried in **Colebrooke cemetery**, near their parents' resting place. Bertha moved to **East Wyke, South Zeal**, and after her passing in 1959, she was laid to rest beside her sister. Their graves, adorned with granite surrounds and lead inscriptions, reflect their enduring legacy.

- **Florence Salter**: "Singer" born February 2nd, 1870, died October 6th, 1942. Inscription: *"Glory be to God on High."*
- **Bertha Salter**: "Singer" born May 24th, 1872, died March 13th, 1959. Inscription: *"And one clear call for me,"* a poignant line from Alfred Lord Tennyson’s poem *Crossing the Bar*.

## Legacy and Cultural Impact

The Salter sisters' contributions to classical music remain timeless. A portrait of Florence by **Jean Ballantyne**, initially misattributed to Bertha, now hangs in the **Devon and Exeter Institution**, thanks to Florence’s generous bequest to **Exeter University**. The portrait serves as a testament to their cultural significance.

Ballantyne, the daughter of **R.M. Ballantyne** (author of *The Coral Island*), was a close friend and neighbour of the sisters in London. Her artistic connection adds another layer to the sisters’ fascinating story.



## Celebrating the Devonshire Nightingales
