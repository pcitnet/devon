# The Ship Inn Brawl of 1853: A Historic Tale from Coleford

In the early 1850s, the construction of the **North Devon Railway** from Crediton to Barnstaple brought a wave of activity to the quiet village of Coleford. The work attracted **navvies** (navigators) tasked with carving out a significant railway cutting east of the village.

## The Ship Inn: Lodging for Navvies

Many of these navvies lodged at **The Ship Inn**, now known as Browns Farm. The inn, managed by landlord **Thomas Peters**, offered basic accommodation for a penny per night. Workers slept on clean straw in an adjacent stone outbuilding. However, the peaceful arrangement took a dark turn one Saturday night in January 1853.

## A Night of Violence

A heated dispute among the navvies escalated into a violent brawl that Mr. Peters was unable to control. Desperate, he summoned **Police Constable John Okeford**, a peace officer employed by the North Devon Railway Company and stationed in Coleford.

### The Attack on PC Okeford

During the melee, PC Okeford sustained serious injuries while attempting to restore order. Villagers rallied to assist Mr. Peters, eventually quelling the violence. On the following Monday, a magistrates' court in Crediton remanded three men—**Robert Harris, Charles Smith, and Robert Burt**—to stand trial for their involvement in the fight.

## The Trial and Verdict

The trial took place in Exeter in early March 1853. The accused faced charges of causing damage to The Ship Inn and inflicting injuries on PC Okeford. During the proceedings, Okeford described how he was attacked, thrown to the ground, and partially hurled through a window. He also reported hearing Burt exclaim, *"Let's burst him, let's finish the b***** off!"*

Landlord Thomas Peters testified that the navvies had been supplied with liquor under **"The Truck System"**, an arrangement where workers were partially paid in vouchers redeemable locally. The court sentenced Harris, Smith, and Burt to 12 months of hard labor.

## The Hunt for the Missing Men

Despite the arrests, three other men involved in the brawl—nicknamed **"Welsh Joe," "Chickey,"** and an unknown individual—were never traced. Descriptions of the men were circulated, but they evaded capture.

## Legacy of the Brawl

The 1853 brawl at The Ship Inn remains a vivid chapter in Coleford's history. It reflects the challenges of maintaining order during a period of rapid industrial development and the human stories behind the construction of the North Devon Railway.
