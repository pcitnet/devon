On 9th March 1991 at 5.00 pm six bellringers and two peal callers
gathered at St. Andrews Church Colebrooke to ring a peal of call changes
on Colebrooke's enormous and tricky 18cwt peal of bells that consisted of 1507 call
changes where different pairs of bells exchange places in a sequence of
six.

The occasion was to raise money for the refurbishment of Colebrooke's
bells. Much needed refreshments were laid on by volunteers at the
village hall afterwards.
