 Colebrooke Parish Hall began life as the village school on August 9th
1875. For the greater part of the 19th century, Colebrooke had a
“Parochial School” supported by subscription. This was in the building
known as the “Old School” at the top of the hill leading into
Colebrooke, recently restored.

 There was also a small “Dame School” at Coleford, which was sponsored
by the Madge sisters of Copplestone House.

 Under the education act of 1870, the state provided for the election of
“School Boards” by parishes with the power to build and manage schools.

 Colebrooke School Board was formed on November 13th 1873 under the
chairmanship of the vicar Rev Thomas Drosier. Samuel Norrish Esq of
Horwell was made treasurer. James Kerswell the former schoolmaster,
acted as clerk and three farmers, John Willcocks of Bolts, William Lee
of Penstone Barton and William Brown of Whelmstone were the other
members of the board. An offer of a site for the school by Mr Samuel
Norrish was gladly accepted, with the proviso that it would revert to
his estate if at any time in the future the school should close. And so
it was that Colebrooke Board School with a teachers house attached (now
known as Chenery House) was erected on this site for the sum of £1679
during 1874/1875. It was known as Colebrooke Board School until the
education act of 1902 when it came under the auspices of the Local
Education Authority and became known as Colebrooke Council School.

 It continued as an all-age mixed school until 1948, when with the
senior pupils having been transferred to Crediton, it became Colebrooke
Primary School, finally closing in 1959. Miss Mary Pope of Bow, whose
late mother was the niece and sole heiress of Samuel Norrish’s estates,
presented the building to the parish to be used as a village hall. The
teacher’s house was sold and the proceeds invested in national savings
to provide an annual income towards the upkeep of the hall.\
