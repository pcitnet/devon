          <description>Colebrooke Church Bells History There have been bells ringing at Colebrooke for centuries, in common with many Devon churches. Even a parish church as small as Colebrooke has supported, almost continuously, the numerous small expenses and occasionally large ones involved in keeping a ring of bells in working order. A large number of records survive which demonstrate to us the dedication with which, among all their other duties, our forbears took care of the bells which we still ring today.</description>

          <description>Colebrooke Parish History Colebrooke Parish THE MANOR Bishop BARTHOLOMEW, in his letter to King Henry II, c. 1170, claimed that “the town of Colebrooke has always from the beginning been, and still is, a part of the Manor of Crediton which belongs to the Church of Exeter and the Episcopal See”. Thus when the Domesday Survey was made in 1086, the manor lands were included in the Crediton totals without being named.</description>

          <description>Coleford’s Pronunciation Coleford in Devon can be pronounced wrongly by a great number of people. The long-standing locals and the correct way to pronounce Coleford is Coal ford, with the O and R in the Ford part as “or”
The Correct Way:   We, the residents of Coleford hear all sorts of alternative expressions used for our village name:
Culfud, Colefud &amp; Colefurd being the most common examples of how to annoy the locals.</description>
