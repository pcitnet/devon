The original public house of that name was situated in what is now the NW corner of the churchyard. According to 17th and early 18th century, churchwardens accounts it was then known as The Church House and appeared to be in constant need of repair.</description></item><item><title>Cob Buildings</title><link>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/10/cob-buildings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:56:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/10/cob-buildings/</guid><description>Cob Building Cicely Fox Smith
OLD cob wall
Have falled at last;
Us knawed he might
A good while past.
Great-grandad he
Built thicky wall
With maiden earth
And oaten straw.
He built en in
The good old way,
And there he’ve stood
Until to-day.
But wind and rain
And frost and snaw
Have all combined
To lay en law.</description></item><item><title>Coleford Police Station</title><link>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/10/coleford-police-station/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2020 10:20:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/10/coleford-police-station/</guid><description>Coleford Police Station Following the recent article in the Bell concerning the injuries received by a constable at the hands of railway navvies, people have asked if Coleford ever had a regular police constable. Before being moved to Copplestone during the 1920s, Coleford had its constable for over 60 years.
Initially, when the Devon Constabulary underwent a significant overhaul in 1856, a guideline was introduced whereby a constable would be provided to look after an area based on acreage and population.</description></item><item><title>The Great Flood of Coleford 1841</title><link>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/10/the-great-flood-of-coleford-1841/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2020 10:50:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/10/the-great-flood-of-coleford-1841/</guid><description>The Great Flood of Coleford 1841 In November 1841 the bottom of Coleford was devastated by floods.
After a vestry meeting chaired by Mr Robert Madge of Copplestone House, the following appeal appeared in the Western Times.
Severe Loss in The Great Storm In consequence of the great fall of rain which occurred on Monday the 29th of November great damage was done in the village of Coleford. The water rose to such a height as to overwhelm workshops, stables, cellars, and a great part of some dwelling houses, some of which were levelled to the ground.</description></item><item><title>Colebrooke Church Bells History</title><link>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/06/colebrooke-church-bells-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 16:09:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/06/colebrooke-church-bells-history/</guid><description>Colebrooke Church Bells History There have been bells ringing at Colebrooke for centuries, in common with many Devon churches. Even a parish church as small as Colebrooke has supported, almost continuously, the numerous small expenses and occasionally large ones involved in keeping a ring of bells in working order. A large number of records survive which demonstrate to us the dedication with which, among all their other duties, our forbears took care of the bells which we still ring today.</description></item><item><title>Colebrooke Church History</title><link>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/06/colebrooke-church-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 16:09:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/06/colebrooke-church-history/</guid><description>Colebrooke Church History Introduction.

This excellent little book was researched and written by Rev. Vyvyan Hope M.A. F.S.A. Rev.

Thus when the Domesday Survey was made in 1086, the manor lands were included in the Crediton totals without being named.</description></item><item><title>Coleford’s Pronunciation</title><link>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/06/colefords-pronunciation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 16:09:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2020/06/colefords-pronunciation/</guid><description>Coleford’s Pronunciation Coleford in Devon can be pronounced wrongly by a great number of people.

The Correct Way: We, the residents of Coleford hear all sorts of alternative expressions used for our village name:
Culfud, Colefud &amp; Colefurd being the most common examples of how to annoy the locals.</description></item></channel></rss>
