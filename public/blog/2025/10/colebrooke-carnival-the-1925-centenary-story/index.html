                <h1 id="colebrooke-carnival">Colebrooke Carnival</h1>
<p>The first week in November marks the centenary of Colebrooke&rsquo;s first and only carnival. In 1925, the sports committee organised the event to raise funds for repairing the church tower. The tower had been declared unsafe for ringing because the pinnacles at the top were loose, and the structure needed extensive repointing.</p>

<p>My father and some friends, all members of the sports committee, either hired or procured a barrel organ, which they carried around the district in the back of Ern Hutchings’ car.<br>
The collection team included (from left to right):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wilf Dart</strong> (North Down)</li>
<li><strong>Ern Hutchings</strong> (Great Wotton)</li>
<li><strong>Albert Salter</strong> (Broomhill)</li>
<li><strong>Albert Enderson</strong> (my father — wearing one of his grandmother’s dresses!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Their photograph was taken in Crediton on the morning of the carnival.</p>
<h2 id="saturday-november-7th-1925">Saturday, November 7th, 1925</h2>
<p>Twelve tableaux — some horse-drawn — lined up at Colebrooke, accompanied by numerous walking “guys”. The parade was led by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wilf Dart</strong> as an African chief</li>
<li><strong>Will Gregory</strong> of East Studham as a Bengal Lancer</li>
<li><strong>Jack Gillard</strong> of Pennyland as a Mountie</li>
<li><strong>Charlie White</strong> of Bear Street (near Butsford) as another African chief</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Crediton Town Band</strong> headed the procession as it left Colebrooke, passing through <strong>Penstone</strong> before arriving at <strong>Coleford</strong>, where stalls and sideshows had been arranged.</p>
<h2 id="the-famous-water-otter-sideshow">The Famous &ldquo;Water Otter&rdquo; Sideshow</h2>
<p>One sideshow, created by <strong>William Tucker</strong> of Spencers, Coleford, caused great amusement. For a small donation, visitors were invited to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Walk right in and see a real live water otter!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inside, however, they found only a kettle on a Primus stove. Visitors quietly exited through the back — until late that evening when a rather inebriated man from the New Inn threw the “otter” out into the street, ending Tucker’s creative fundraiser!</p>
<h2 id="popular-tableaux-everybody-works-but-father">Popular Tableaux: <em>Everybody Works but Father</em></h2>
<p>This crowd-pleaser was created by <strong>Miss Mounsden</strong>, assistant teacher at Colebrooke School. It featured:</p>

<ul>
<li>Children busy with pots, pans, and brushes</li>
<li>An older man asleep in a chair</li>
</ul>
<p>The children are pictured at the school gate with Miss Mounsden, waiting to board their tableaux.</p>
<h2 id="the-our-jazz-band-performers">The “Our Jazz Band” Performers</h2>
<p>Among the walking groups was <strong>Our Jazz Band</strong> — older schoolboys directed by headmaster <strong>Mr Mabley</strong>. Earlier in the day, they had performed around the district.</p>
<p>Later that evening, the <strong>Crediton Banjo Band</strong> provided music for a dance in the schoolroom, which had been rearranged for the event. In a tea break, the <strong>Chulmleigh handbell ringers</strong> gave a delightful exhibition of change ringing.</p>
<h2 id="a-successful-outcome">A Successful Outcome</h2>
<p>Thanks to the community’s efforts, <strong>Colebrooke church bells rang out again in February 1926</strong> at a thanksgiving service for the completion of the tower repairs.</p>
