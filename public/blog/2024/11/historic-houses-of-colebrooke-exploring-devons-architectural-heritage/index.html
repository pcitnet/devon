<p>The picturesque village of <strong>Colebrooke in Devon</strong> is steeped in history, with its old houses showcasing centuries of architectural evolution. From ancient vicarages to transformed properties, the village is a treasure trove for history enthusiasts. This article delves into the fascinating story of one iconic structure—the Old Vicarage.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-old-vicarage-a-glimpse-into-the-14th-century">The Old Vicarage: A Glimpse Into the 14th Century</h2>
<p>Dating back to the <strong>14th century</strong>, the Old Vicarage in Colebrooke was once a prominent residence in the village. In 1821, it was meticulously described in the document, <em>A Terrier of the Glebe House and Lands of the Parish of Colebrooke</em>. The layout included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two parlours, a vestibule, and a passage on the ground floor.</li>
<li>A kitchen, five chambers, and a closet on the upper floor.</li>
<li>Additional buildings such as a brewhouse with a cellar, dairy with a cheese room, stable, barn, linhay, woodhouse, and coal house.</li>
<li>Outdoor structures for poultry and storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The property’s thatched roof, except for a tiled section over the back entrance, was a hallmark of traditional architecture.</p>

<h2 id="the-decline-and-reconstruction-of-the-vicarage">The Decline and Reconstruction of the Vicarage</h2>
<p>By 1885, the Old Vicarage had fallen into disrepair. The Rev. Isidore Daimpre, appointed that year, struggled with the building&rsquo;s condition, which contributed to financial challenges. After leaving the parish temporarily in 1889, Rev. Daimpre returned in 1897 to campaign for a new vicarage.</p>
<p>In <strong>1908</strong>, a grant of £1,000 from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners marked the beginning of this transformation. Additional funding followed in 1909, but the demolition of the Old Vicarage was delayed. Preservationists, led by the Antiquarian Society, recognized its architectural significance.</p>

<p>Demolition eventually began on <strong>July 25, 1912</strong>, making way for a new structure designed by <strong>E. H. Harbottle and Son of Exeter</strong>. A historic moment followed on <strong>August 4, 1912</strong>, when the foundation stone was laid by <strong>Mr. Charles Calmady Hamlyn of Paschoe</strong>. The ceremony symbolized Colebrooke&rsquo;s blend of preservation and progress, with a mallet crafted from the old vicarage’s oak beams.</p>
