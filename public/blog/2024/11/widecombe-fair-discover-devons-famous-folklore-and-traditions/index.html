<p>Widecombe Fair, held annually each September in the picturesque village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor on Dartmoor, is one of Devon’s most iconic cultural events. Renowned for its charm, rich history, and connection to the famous folk song &ldquo;Widecombe Fair,&rdquo; this event continues to draw visitors from far and wide.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-behind-widecombe-fair">The History Behind Widecombe Fair</h2>
<p>The fair’s fame owes much to the traditional folk song &ldquo;Widecombe Fair,&rdquo; which was collected by Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould in the late 19th century. The song recounts the humorous story of Tom Pearse, who lends his grey mare to a group of companions, including the legendary Uncle Tom Cobley, for a journey to the fair.</p>
<h2 id="who-were-tom-pearse-and-uncle-tom-cobley">Who Were Tom Pearse and Uncle Tom Cobley?</h2>
<p>The characters in &ldquo;Widecombe Fair&rdquo; have long intrigued folklorists and historians. Many believe these figures were inspired by real individuals from Devon.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tom Pearse</strong>: The Pearse family, who farmed Road Farm in the 19th century, likely owned the grey mare central to the tale.</li>
<li><strong>Uncle Tom Cobley</strong>: Historical records point to two individuals named Tom Cobley from Spreyton. One, a bachelor who died in 1794 at the age of 96, was a well-known landowner. His great-nephew, also named Thomas Cobley, was a farmer and avid huntsman who lived until 1844. Interestingly, a note in Spreyton’s burial register mentions him as the &ldquo;supposed subject of the well-known song.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="widecombe-fairs-connection-to-colebrooke">Widecombe Fair’s Connection to Colebrooke</h2>
<p>Mabel Lee, a former landlady of The New Inn in Colebrooke, identified several Colebrooke residents as possible inspirations for the characters in the song. Names like Brewer, Davey, Stewer (or Steer), and Gurney were common in the area, while Whiddon and Hawke trace their roots to Whiddon Down, another nearby locality.</p>
<h2 id="why-widecombe-fair-is-special">Why Widecombe Fair is Special</h2>
<p>Widecombe Fair is not just about its folklore—it’s a vibrant celebration of Dartmoor’s culture and traditions. Visitors can enjoy craft stalls, local food, livestock displays, and entertainment, all set against the stunning backdrop of Dartmoor National Park.</p>
