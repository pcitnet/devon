    <p>During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Arscott family were integral to Colebrooke parish. Three generations had held the post of parish clerk. Two of the mills, Colebrooke and Ford, were run by Arscotts and shoemakers, a blacksmith, a carpenter, and a tailor. Today, the only tangible evidence of their existence is the sampler that used to hang in the committee room at the Village Hall, which was rescued from The Old School when it was sold in 1960 and the memorial to Frederick Arscott in the church the north wall.<span> <a href="https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2022/03/the-arscotts-of-colebrooke/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>Some Interesting Occupants of Paschoe House 1870 - 1940 After the Calmady-Hamlyn family ceased to live in the new house at Paschoe, it was occupied by various tenants until St Georges School arrived in 1940.
An early occupier was Mr Robert Lodwick Esq. He was a sporting gentleman who, within a few weeks of his arrival, had invited the local hunt to breakfast at Paschoe. He was also something of an entertainer and, at local events, would delight the audience with humorous songs.<span> <a href="https://www.colebrooke.org/blog/2022/03/paschoe-house-occupants-1870-1940/">Read more...</a></span>
