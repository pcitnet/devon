    <p>Coleford’s Pronunciation Coleford in Devon can be pronounced wrongly by a great number of people. The long-standing locals and the correct way to pronounce Coleford is Coal ford, with the O and R in the Ford part as “or”
We, the residents of Coleford hear all sorts of alternative expressions used for our village name:
Culfud &amp; Colefurd being the most common examples of how to annoy the locals.
As far as we know there are only three villages in Devon with the emphasis on the “Ford”.<span> <a href="/blog/1/01/colefords-pronunciation/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>Colebrooke Parish History Colebrooke Parish THE MANOR Bishop BARTHOLOMEW, in his letter to King Henry II, c. 1170, claimed that “the town of Colebrooke has always from the beginning been, and still is, a part of the Manor of Crediton which belongs to the Church of Exeter and the Episcopal See”. Thus when the Domesday Survey was made in 1086, the manor lands were included in the Crediton totals without being named.<span> <a href="/blog/1/01/colebrooke-parish-history/">Read more...</a></span>
