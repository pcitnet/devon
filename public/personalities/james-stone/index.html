                <h1 id="james-stone-the-little-elephant-of-devonshire-wrestling-17981841">James Stone: The Little Elephant of Devonshire Wrestling (1798–1841)</h1>
<p>James Stone, famously known as &ldquo;The Little Elephant,&rdquo; was a celebrated Devonshire wrestler and farmer. Born on <strong>March 28, 1798</strong>, in Crediton, Devon, James&rsquo;s incredible strength and unmatched skill in Devonshire wrestling earned him a prominent place in British sporting history.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-of-james-stone">Early Life of James Stone</h2>
<p>James Stone was born at <strong>Knowle Farm, Crediton</strong>, the second son of James Stone and Elizabeth Francis. In <strong>1804</strong>, his family moved to <strong>Furzedown Farm in Copplestone</strong>, within the parish of Colebrooke. This farm had been in the Stone family for nearly a century, marking their deep-rooted ties to the region.</p>
<h2 id="a-champion-of-devonshire-wrestling">A Champion of Devonshire Wrestling</h2>
<p>As a young man, James Stone became a prominent figure in <strong>Devonshire wrestling</strong>, a traditional style known for allowing kicks below the knee. His small stature—<strong>5 feet 4 inches tall and weighing over 13 stone</strong>—earned him the affectionate nickname &ldquo;The Little Elephant.&rdquo; Despite his size, James&rsquo;s incredible strength made him a formidable competitor.</p>
<h3 id="james-stones-achievements-in-wrestling">James Stone’s Achievements in Wrestling</h3>
<ul>

<li>Competed in high-profile matches across England, including <strong>Leeds</strong> and <strong>The Eagle Tavern in London</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="life-after-wrestling-marriage-and-farming">Life After Wrestling: Marriage and Farming</h2>
<p>James Stone married <strong>Ann Gibbings</strong> on <strong>November 1, 1828</strong>, in Coldridge, Crediton. Ann, born at Chilverton Farm in Coldridge, brought a strong farming background to the union. Together, they settled at <strong>Hooke Farm</strong>, which they acquired from James&rsquo;s sister, Mary.</p>
<p>By <strong>1839</strong>, the couple had seven children, with another on the way. James’s life as a farmer seemed promising, but his ambitions soon turned toward opportunities abroad.</p>
<h2 id="the-journey-to-australia">The Journey to Australia</h2>
<p>In <strong>July 1840</strong>, James left for <strong>Sydney, New South Wales</strong>, seeking a new life for his family. He secured a position as a station manager for Samuel Furneaux Mann, a major landowner in the <strong>New England district</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="tragic-end-the-murder-of-james-stone">Tragic End: The Murder of James Stone</h3>
<p>On <strong>July 28, 1841</strong>, James Stone was tragically murdered at Beardy Plains, New England. The incident occurred during a dispute with <strong>Thomas Homer</strong>, a convict laborer. Homer was later tried, convicted of willful murder, and executed in <strong>1842</strong>.</p>

<p>Back in Devon, Ann Stone managed <strong>Hooke Farm</strong> until their eldest son, James Jr., took over in <strong>1861</strong>. Ann later moved to <strong>Lower Chilverton Farm</strong>, where she lived with her brothers. She passed away on <strong>July 9, 1874</strong>, after a carriage accident and was laid to rest in <strong>Coldridge churchyard</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="james-stones-legacy-in-literature-and-history">James Stone’s Legacy in Literature and History</h2>
<p>James Stone’s life and untimely death inspired the character <strong>James Stockbridge</strong> in Henry Kingsley&rsquo;s 1858 novel, <em>The Recollections of Geoffrey Hamlyn</em>. This character, like Stone, was a farmer and wrestler whose life mirrored the real events of Colebrooke.</p>
