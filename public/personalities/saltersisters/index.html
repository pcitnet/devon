<h1 id="the-salter-sisters-devons-beloved-devonshire-nightingales">The Salter Sisters: Devon’s Beloved &ldquo;Devonshire Nightingales&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Florence and Bertha Salter, affectionately known as the <em>&ldquo;Devonshire Nightingales&rdquo;</em>, were celebrated classical vocalists originating from the picturesque village of Colebrooke, Devon. Their melodious voices and remarkable careers have left a lasting legacy in the world of classical music.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-rise-to-fame">Early Life and Rise to Fame</h2>
<p>Born at <strong>Broomhill Farm</strong> in 1870 (Florence) and 1872 (Bertha), the Salter sisters grew up surrounded by the serene beauty of rural Devon. Their musical journey began with a promising concert at <strong>Crediton Town Hall</strong> in 1890. Encouraged by their talented singing instructor, <strong>Mr. Jekyll of Exeter</strong>, the sisters pursued professional training in Brussels, refining their vocal artistry.</p>
<p>In 1893, their undeniable talent brought them before <strong>Queen Marie Henriette of Belgium</strong> and <strong>Princess Clementine</strong>, a royal audience that solidified their reputation. Their performances in <strong>Biarritz</strong>, attended by <strong>King Oscar of Sweden</strong>, also earned widespread acclaim, with the French press hailing their extraordinary abilities.</p>
<h2 id="a-flourishing-career-the-devonshire-nightingales">A Flourishing Career: The Devonshire Nightingales</h2>
<p>For over two decades, the Salter sisters captivated audiences across Britain and Europe. Touring extensively, they gained the affectionate title of the <em>&ldquo;Devonshire Nightingales.&rdquo;</em> By 1901, the sisters had settled in <strong>Paddington, London</strong>, listed as &ldquo;classical vocalists&rdquo; in the census. A decade later, they moved to <strong>Chelsea</strong>, continuing to thrive as &ldquo;professional vocalists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of their final recorded performances occurred in <strong>September 1917</strong>, where they sang to support a military hospital in <strong>Colchester</strong>, demonstrating their commitment to using their talents for good causes.</p>
<h2 id="returning-to-devon-a-quiet-retirement">Returning to Devon: A Quiet Retirement</h2>
<p>In the 1930s, Florence and Bertha returned to their Devon roots, settling in the seaside town of <strong>Dawlish</strong>. Florence passed away in 1942 and was buried in <strong>Colebrooke cemetery</strong>, near their parents&rsquo; resting place. Bertha moved to <strong>East Wyke, South Zeal</strong>, and after her passing in 1959, she was laid to rest beside her sister. Their graves, adorned with granite surrounds and lead inscriptions, reflect their enduring legacy.</p>

<li><strong>Florence Salter</strong>: &ldquo;Singer&rdquo; born February 2nd, 1870, died October 6th, 1942. Inscription: <em>&ldquo;Glory be to God on High.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><strong>Bertha Salter</strong>: &ldquo;Singer&rdquo; born May 24th, 1872, died March 13th, 1959. Inscription: <em>&ldquo;And one clear call for me,&rdquo;</em> a poignant line from Alfred Lord Tennyson’s poem <em>Crossing the Bar</em>.</li>

<p>The Salter sisters&rsquo; contributions to classical music remain timeless. A portrait of Florence by <strong>Jean Ballantyne</strong>, initially misattributed to Bertha, now hangs in the <strong>Devon and Exeter Institution</strong>, thanks to Florence’s generous bequest to <strong>Exeter University</strong>. The portrait serves as a testament to their cultural significance.</p>
<p>Ballantyne, the daughter of <strong>R.M. Ballantyne</strong> (author of <em>The Coral Island</em>), was a close friend and neighbour of the sisters in London. Her artistic connection adds another layer to the sisters’ fascinating story.</p>

<p>Today, the Salter sisters are remembered not only for their extraordinary voices but also for their deep connection to Devon. Their story, immortalized in <strong>Colebrooke cemetery</strong> and celebrated in historical records, continues to inspire music lovers and historians alike.
